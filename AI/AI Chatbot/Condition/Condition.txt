In this activity, we will be using a Python library, chatterbot, to implement a chatbot.
This library generates automated responses to the user input. The responses are based on machine learning algorithms implemented in the library.
Our goal is to make sure that the chatbot is trained in multiple languages in order to cater to different communities.
The ML algorithms make it easier for the chatbot to improve and evolve its responses over time as it collects user responses.

Write a program that outputs a set of strings derived from
of the original string (more than 20 characters long) according to the principle: after each
a' insert the number 5 after each 'a'. For example, the original string:
'the character string will be converted into a set of strings'
The result will be:
‘строка5’
‘ символов будет пребра5’
‘зова5’
‘на5’
‘ в на5’
‘бор строк’
